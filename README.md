# Surviving Europa Game
This is a desktop strategy game was developed by me and my teammate William Barteck for the Technology Student Association (TSA) Video Game Design Competition.  We recieved first place in the Maryland state competition, in 2015.  The project was developed using ActionScript and Adobe Flash Pro CS6.

The objective of the game is to colonize Europa (the 6th moon from Jupiter) and survive.  You must use strategy to build, allocate, and use your resources efficiently. To play the game, download SurvivingEuropa.exe and run it.
