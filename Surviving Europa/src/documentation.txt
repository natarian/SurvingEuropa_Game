Surviving Europa v0.6.1 - Andrew Natarian & William Barteck

Description:



------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tile Types - this is just a convention for creating tiles

NW(X7X)	 N(X3X)   NE(X16X)
W(X4X)	[ ]	  E(X2X)
SW(X8X)	 S(X1X)	  SE(X5X)

999	- selector
0  	- blank
0-89	- unused
9X 	- flat tiles
100s	- standard cube tiles
	10X	- different styles
	11X	- S Incline, matching styles
	12X	- E Incline
	13X 	- N Incline
	14X	- W Incline
	15X	- SE corner
	16X	- NE corner
	17X	- NW corner
	18X	- SW corner

200s	same thing as 100s
	but up 1 level
300s, 
400s, 
500s, 
etc,	same as before, but up levels

tile sizes
small 	- 32x16 
medium	- 64x32
large	- 128x64 (this one)

Building Descriptions

Lander:
-non upgradable
-must land before operations can begin
---------------

MissionControl:
-produces funds for the colony
-upgrade levels provide more funds per cycle
-establishes comunication with earth (this can be a special function)
-funds are limitless

-funds could go missing randomly(reassigned back on earth)
-funds could be added randomly but not often.
---------------

PowerStation:
-supplies the colony with energy
-upgrade levels provide more energy per cycle.

-solar panels could break, freezing the building for a time
--------------

IceDrill:
-extracts ice -> water for colony
-upgrades get more water at a time

-drill bit can break, freezing the building for a time
-water supply could run out
--------------

MiningDrill:
-extracts metal from the ground
-upgrades get more metal at a time

-drill can break freezing the building
-metal can run out
--------------

HydroponicsFarm:
-converts water to food (and oxygen?)
-upgrades make it more efficient/produce more

-plants can die, freezing the building
-water shortage can freeze the building
--------------

ElectrolysisStation:
-converts water to oxygen and hydrogen fuel
-upgrades make it more efficient and produce more

-water shortage can freeze the building
-electrodes could break freezing the building.
-maybe explode
--------------

HabitationModule:
-Expands human capacity to allow for upgrades and buildings
-upgrades further increase capacity

-requires fuel or electricity

-can not break 
--------------

StorageBuilding:
-increases storage capacity for all resources
-upgrades increase storage more
-can not be improved by other buildings
--------------

building ideas not yet being implemented
-improvement building that speeds up adjacent buildings
-combined drill that mines 3 different resources depending on placement (water, oil, metal)

Levels

Tutorial
-learn interface
-place mission control
-radio back your accomplishments

Level 1

-get water
-drill tile
	-scan with rover for water
	-consequences for drilling without water:
		-unusable tile
		-poison gas
		-broken drill
-send data with mission control
start next mission


Level 2 

-find/create oxygen
-made from water
-water splitter building - electrolysis
-objective:get a certain amount of water/oxygen
	-storage tanks building

level 3 

-create food
-use water and oxygen
-hydropnics building / upgrade
